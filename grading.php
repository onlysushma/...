<p>The grading system has been prepared by the Curriculum Development Center and was officially passed by the National Curriculum Development and Evaluation Council. The Council will function under the Ministry of Education.
This new grading system has it that no student's SLC certificate will carry either pass or fail status. And hardly any student will fail Class 10 board exams, too. Here is the SLC Grading system of Nepal.</p>
<p>
Under the grading system, the test scores will be judged as follows: “A+” for students securing between 90 to 100 percent marks; “A” for students scoring between 80 and 89 percent marks; “B” for students scoring 60 to 79 percent marks; “C” for students scoring between 40 to 59 percent marks; “D” for students scoring 25 to 39 percent marks; “E” for students scoring below 25 percent marks; and “F” for students who have failed their exams.</p>
